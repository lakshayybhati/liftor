## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Missing Supabase credentials"
**Fix**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values.

### "RevenueCat not configured"
**Fix**: Add Android API key to `app.json` ‚Üí `extra.EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_API_KEY`

### "EAS project not found"
**Fix**: Run `eas init` and update `app.json` with the projectId.

### "Build fails on iOS"
**Fix**: Let EAS manage credentials: `eas credentials` ‚Üí select "Generate new credentials"

### "Build fails on Android"
**Fix**: Ensure package name is unique and matches Play Console app.

### "Screenshots don't match requirements"
**Fix**: iOS requires 1290x2796 for 6.7" display. Android recommends 1080x1920 or 1440x2560.

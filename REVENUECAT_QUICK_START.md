## 🌍 Multi-Currency Support

### **IT JUST WORKS!** 🎉

No code changes needed. RevenueCat + StoreKit automatically:
- Detect user's region (USA, UK, India, etc.)
- Fetch prices in local currency
- Display with correct symbol ($, £, €, ₹)

**Examples:**
- 🇺🇸 American user → `$9.99/mo`
- 🇬🇧 UK user → `£9.99/mo`
- 🇮🇳 Indian user → `₹799/mo`
- 🇪🇺 EU user → `€9.99/mo`

Your paywall already displays these correctly using:
```tsx
package.product.priceString // Localized automatically!
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (3 Simple Tasks)

### Step 1: Build New Version
```bash
# For TestFlight
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# For testing
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

### Step 2: Verify Configuration

**App Store Connect** (for BOTH Monthly and Annual):
1. Go to Subscriptions → [Product] → Pricing
2. Verify price table shows under "Current Pricing"
3. If not: Add price → Done → **Save**
4. Verify "Cleared for Sale" = ON
5. Verify "All Countries and Regions" selected

**RevenueCat Dashboard**:
1. Entitlements → `elite` → verify both products attached
2. Offerings → `elite` → verify blue checkmark (Current)
3. Packages → verify `$rc_annual` and `$rc_monthly` exist

### Step 3: Test on Device
1. Install TestFlight build
2. Sign in with sandbox Apple ID
3. Complete onboarding → paywall appears
4. Verify plans show with prices
5. Try purchase (sandbox - no charge)
6. Verify access granted after purchase

## 🧪 Testing Multi-Currency

### Create Sandbox Testers (Recommended)
1. **App Store Connect** → Users and Access → Sandbox Testers
2. Create 2-3 testers:
   - USA tester (USD)
   - UK tester (GBP)
   - India tester (INR)
3. On device:
   - Settings → App Store → Sandbox Account
   - Sign in with tester
4. Open app → verify currency changes

### What to Check ✅
- Currency symbol correct for region
- Price formatting appropriate
- Discount % calculates correctly
- Annual → monthly shows correct symbol
- Purchase completes successfully

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No plans available"
**Fix**: App Store Connect pricing not saved
1. Subscriptions → Pricing → Add price → Done → **Save**
2. Wait 1-4 hours for propagation
3. Kill app, reopen

### Wrong currency shown
**Fix**: Sandbox account region mismatch
1. Use region-specific sandbox tester
2. Or change Apple ID region in Settings

### Purchase doesn't grant access
**Fix**: Entitlement configuration
1. RevenueCat → Entitlements → `elite`
2. Verify products attached
3. Verify identifier matches `app.json`

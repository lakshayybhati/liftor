# Documented Plan Generation System - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 System Overview

This implementation follows the **exact specifications** from the plan generation documentation. The system has been completely rebuilt to match the documented two-tier architecture and all specified processes.

## 🏗️ Two-Tier Architecture Implementation

### **Tier 1: Base Plan Generation** (`generateWeeklyBasePlan`)
- **Purpose**: Creates foundational 7-day template during onboarding
- **Input**: Comprehensive user profile with 40+ data points
- **Output**: Complete `WeeklyBasePlan` object with all 7 days
- **API**: Uses `https://toolkit.rork.com/text/llm/` as documented

### **Tier 2: Daily Plan Adjustment** (`generateDailyPlan`)
- **Purpose**: Takes base plan and adjusts daily based on check-in data
- **Input**: User profile, today's check-in, recent patterns, base plan
- **Output**: Adjusted `DailyPlan` with micro-modifications
- **Approach**: "Daily Titration Specialist" for targeted adjustments

## 📊 User Profile Building (40+ Data Points)

The system collects and processes the exact data points specified in the documentation:

### Basic Stats (6 points)
- Age, sex, weight, height, activity level, goal

### Training Preferences (5 points)
- Equipment available, training days, session length, preferred exercises, avoided exercises

### Dietary Information (5 points)
- Dietary preferences, calorie target, meal count, fasting window, supplements

### Goals & Limitations (4 points)
- Personal goals, perceived weaknesses, injuries, special requests

### Lifestyle Factors (3+ points)
- Timezone, travel days, additional constraints

## 🤖 AI Prompt Engineering (Exact Implementation)

### Base Plan System Prompt
```
You are a world-class Personal Trainer & Nutrition Specialist. 
Create a 7-Day Base Plan that EXACTLY matches the user's specific requirements.

=== USER'S EXACT REQUIREMENTS ===
[40+ data points from user profile]

=== MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS ===
🏋️ EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE: [user equipment]
🎯 FITNESS GOAL: [user goal]
📅 TRAINING DAYS: [X] days per week
⏱️ SESSION LENGTH: [X] minutes MAX
🍽️ DIETARY PREFERENCE: [user diet]
🚫 AVOID EXERCISES: [user avoids]
✅ PREFERRED EXERCISES: [user prefers]
```

### Daily Adjustment System Prompt
```
You are a Daily Titration Specialist. Your job is to take a BASE PLAN 
and make small, data-driven adjustments based on today's check-in data.

ADJUSTMENT RULES:
- Low Energy/Poor Sleep: -20-30% volume, cap intensity at RIR≥2
- Soreness/Injury: auto-swap or skip affected patterns
- Travel/Busy: switch to 20-30min bodyweight circuits
- Great Recovery: allow +1 set on primaries
```

## 🔍 JSON Processing Pipeline (Multi-Layer Validation)

### Step-by-Step Processing
1. **Remove Markdown**: Strip ```json``` code blocks
2. **Extract Boundaries**: Find matching braces using brace counting
3. **Parse JSON**: Attempt JSON.parse with detailed error reporting
4. **Structure Validation**: Verify all required sections exist
5. **Content Validation**: Check calories, protein, exercise compliance

### Validation Requirements
- **All 7 Days**: Monday through Sunday must be present
- **Complete Sections**: Each day needs workout, nutrition, recovery
- **Proper Structure**: Blocks, items, meals must be arrays
- **User Compliance**: Equipment, dietary, exercise preferences respected

## 🛡️ Adaptive Fallback Systems

### Base Plan Fallback
When AI generation fails, the system creates intelligent fallback plans:
- **Equipment-Specific Workouts**: Uses only available equipment
- **Dietary-Compliant Nutrition**: Respects vegetarian/eggitarian/non-veg
- **Goal-Appropriate Calories**: TDEE calculation with goal adjustments
- **Smart Workout Splits**: 1-7 day splits based on training frequency

### Daily Adjustment Fallback
Rule-based adjustments when AI titration fails:
- **Energy < 5**: Reduce volume by 20-30%, increase RIR to 2+
- **Stress > 7**: Switch to recovery protocol (breathing, yoga, walking)
- **Soreness Present**: Modify affected muscle group exercises
- **Sleep < 6hrs**: Emphasize mobility, reduce intensity

## 📈 TDEE & Macro Calculations

### BMR Calculation (Mifflin-St Jeor Equation)
- **Male**: BMR = 10 × weight + 6.25 × height - 5 × age + 5
- **Female**: BMR = 10 × weight + 6.25 × height - 5 × age - 161

### Activity Multipliers
- Sedentary: 1.2
- Lightly Active: 1.375
- Moderately Active: 1.55
- Very Active: 1.725
- Extremely Active: 1.9

### Goal Adjustments
- **Weight Loss**: TDEE × 0.85 (-15%)
- **Muscle Gain**: TDEE × 1.15 (+15%)
- **Maintenance**: TDEE × 1.0

### Protein Target
- **Formula**: 0.9g per pound of body weight
- **Minimum**: Based on calorie percentage if weight unavailable

## 🎯 Workout Split Generation

### Training Day Splits
```typescript
const splits = {
  1: ['Full Body'],
  2: ['Upper Body', 'Lower Body'],
  3: ['Push', 'Pull', 'Legs'],
  4: ['Push', 'Pull', 'Legs', 'Upper Body'],
  5: ['Push', 'Pull', 'Legs', 'Push', 'Pull'],
  6: ['Push', 'Pull', 'Legs', 'Push', 'Pull', 'Legs'],
  7: ['Push', 'Pull', 'Legs', 'Upper', 'Lower', 'Full', 'Recovery']
};
```

### Equipment-Specific Exercise Database
- **Gym**: Full equipment access (barbells, machines, etc.)
- **Dumbbells**: Dumbbell-specific movements
- **Bodyweight**: No equipment required exercises
- **Bands**: Resistance band variations

## 🍽️ Nutrition Plan Generation

### Meal Templates by Dietary Preference

#### Vegetarian
- Breakfast: Oatmeal with plant protein powder
- Lunch: Quinoa bowl with legumes and vegetables  
- Dinner: Tofu stir-fry with brown rice

#### Eggitarian
- Breakfast: Scrambled eggs with whole grain toast
- Lunch: Egg salad with quinoa
- Dinner: Vegetable omelet with sweet potato

#### Non-Vegetarian
- Breakfast: Greek yogurt with protein powder
- Lunch: Grilled chicken with rice and vegetables
- Dinner: Fish with quinoa and salad

### Meal Count Adaptation
- **3 Meals**: Standard breakfast, lunch, dinner
- **4+ Meals**: Add protein-rich snacks
- **5+ Meals**: Add second snack option

## 🔄 Daily Adjustment Rules Engine

### Energy-Based Adjustments
- **High Energy (8-10)**: Allow +1 set on primary exercises
- **Moderate Energy (5-7)**: Maintain base plan
- **Low Energy (1-4)**: Reduce volume by 20-30%, increase RIR

### Stress Management
- **Low Stress (1-3)**: Normal training intensity
- **Moderate Stress (4-6)**: Maintain plan with mobility focus
- **High Stress (7-10)**: Switch to recovery protocol

### Sleep Quality Impact
- **Good Sleep (7-9hrs)**: Normal progression
- **Poor Sleep (<6hrs)**: Reduce intensity, emphasize recovery
- **Excellent Sleep (9+hrs)**: Allow slight intensity increase

### Soreness Handling
- **No Soreness**: Proceed with plan
- **Mild Soreness**: Reduce intensity for affected areas
- **Significant Soreness**: Skip or substitute affected exercises

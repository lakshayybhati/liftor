Plan Generation Process Overview  
1\. Data Collection Phase (Onboarding)  
The process starts in app/onboarding.tsx where comprehensive user data is collected:  
const userData \= {  
goal: 'WEIGHT\_LOSS' | 'MUSCLE\_GAIN' | 'GENERAL\_FITNESS',  
equipment: \['Gym', 'Dumbbells', 'Bodyweight'\],  
dietaryPrefs: \['Vegetarian', 'Non-veg', 'Eggitarian'\],  
trainingDays: 3-7,  
age, sex, weight, height, activityLevel,  
dailyCalorieTarget: calculated via BMR/TDEE,  
supplements, personalGoals, perceivedLacks,  
preferredExercises, avoidExercises,  
sessionLength, fastingWindow, mealCount,  
injuries, specialRequests, etc.  
}  
2\. Base Plan Generation (app/generating-base-plan.tsx)  
Step 1: User Profile Building  
const userProfile \= \[  
\`Goal: ${user.goal}\`,  
\`Equipment: ${user.equipment.join(', ')}\`,  
\`Diet: ${user.dietaryPrefs.join(', ')}\`,  
// ... all user preferences  
\].filter(Boolean).join('\\n');  
Step 2: AI Prompt ConstructionThe system sends a detailed prompt to the AI API:  
const systemPrompt \= \`You are a world-class Personal Trainer & Nutrition Specialist.   
Create a 7-Day Base Plan that EXACTLY matches the user's specific requirements.

\=== USER'S EXACT REQUIREMENTS \===  
${userProfile}

\=== MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS \===  
üèãÔ∏è EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE: ${user.equipment.join(', ')}  
üéØ FITNESS GOAL: ${user.goal}  
üìÖ TRAINING DAYS: ${user.trainingDays} days per week  
‚è±Ô∏è SESSION LENGTH: ${user.sessionLength || 45} minutes MAX  
// ... more constraints

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:  
{  
"days": {  
  "monday": {  
    "workout": {  
      "focus": \["Primary muscle groups"\],  
      "blocks": \[  
        {  
          "name": "Warm-up",  
          "items": \[{"exercise": "Dynamic stretching", "sets": 1, "reps": "5-8 min", "RIR": 0}\]  
        }  
      \],  
      "notes": "Specific notes"  
    },  
    "nutrition": {  
      "total\_kcal": ${targetCalories},  
      "protein\_g": ${proteinTarget},  
      "meals": \[  
        {  
          "name": "Breakfast",  
          "items": \[{"food": "Specific food item", "qty": "Exact quantity"}\]  
        }  
      \],  
      "hydration\_l": 2.5  
    },  
    "recovery": {  
      "mobility": \["Specific mobility work"\],  
      "sleep": \["Sleep optimization tip"\]  
    }  
  }  
  // ... all 7 days  
}  
}\`;  
Step 3: JSON Processing & Validation  
// Clean AI response  
let cleanedResponse \= data.completion.trim();  
cleanedResponse \= cleanedResponse.replace(/  
json\\s\\n?|\`\`\`\\s\\n?/g, '');

// Parse and validate structure  
const parsedPlan \= JSON.parse(jsonString);  
if (\!parsedPlan.days || \!parsedPlan.days.monday.workout) {  
  throw new Error('Invalid plan structure');  
}

// Create WeeklyBasePlan object  
const basePlan: WeeklyBasePlan \= {  
  id: Date.now().toString(),  
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),  
  days: parsedPlan.days,  
  isLocked: false,  
};  
\#\#\# 3\. \*\*Daily Plan Adjustment (\`app/generating-plan.tsx\`)\*\*

\*\*Step 1: Check-in Data Analysis\*\*  
typescript  
const todayCheckin \= getTodayCheckin(); // Energy, stress, sleep, soreness, mood  
const recentCheckins \= getRecentCheckins(15); // Historical patterns  
const basePlan \= getCurrentBasePlan(); // Today's base template  
\*\*Step 2: Dynamic Adjustment Prompt\*\*  
typescript  
const systemPrompt \= \`You are a Daily Titration Specialist.   
Take a BASE PLAN and make small, data-driven adjustments based on today's check-in data.

BASE PLAN FOR TODAY (${todayKey.toUpperCase()}):  
Workout: ${JSON.stringify(todayBasePlan.workout)}  
Nutrition: ${JSON.stringify(todayBasePlan.nutrition)}

TODAY'S CHECK-IN STATE:  
\- Energy: ${todayCheckin.energy}/10  
\- Stress: ${todayCheckin.stress}/10  
\- Sleep: ${todayCheckin.sleepHrs}h (${todayCheckin.wokeFeeling})  
\- Soreness: ${todayCheckin.soreness?.join(', ') || 'None'}

ADJUSTMENT RULES:  
\- Low energy/poor sleep: \-20-30% volume, cap intensity at RIR‚â•2  
\- Soreness: auto-swap affected patterns, redistribute volume  
\- Great recovery: allow \+1 set on primaries

Return ONLY adjusted JSON with same structure.\`;  
\*\*Step 3: Fallback System\*\*  
If AI fails, an adaptive fallback generates plans based on user data:  
typescript  
const adaptiveFallbackPlan \= (user: User, checkin: CheckinData): DailyPlan \=\> {  
  const isLowEnergy \= (checkin.energy || 5\) \< 5;  
  const hasEquipment \= user.equipment.some(eq \=\> eq \!== 'Bodyweight');  
    
  return {  
    workout: {  
      focus: isLowEnergy ? \['Recovery'\] : hasEquipment ? \['Upper Body'\] : \['Full Body'\],  
      blocks: \[/ adaptive exercises based on equipment/energy /\]  
    },  
    nutrition: {  
      total\_kcal: user.dailyCalorieTarget || 2000,  
      meals: \[/ adaptive meals based on dietary preferences /\]  
    }  
  };  
};  
\#\#\# 4\. \*\*Plan Display (\`app/plan.tsx\`)\*\*

\*\*JSON Structure Rendering:\*\*  
typescript  
// Workout Tab  
{plan.workout.blocks.map((block, blockIndex) \=\> (  
  \<Card key={blockIndex}\>  
    \<Text\>{block.name}\</Text\>  
    {block.items.map((item, itemIndex) \=\> (  
      \<View key={itemIndex}\>  
        \<Text\>{item.exercise}\</Text\>  
        \<Text\>{item.sets} sets √ó {item.reps} (RIR {item.RIR})\</Text\>  
      \</View\>  
    ))}  
  \</Card\>  
))}

// Nutrition Tab  
\<Text\>{plan.nutrition.total\_kcal} of {totalCalorieTarget} Cal Eaten\</Text\>  
{plan.nutrition.meals.map((meal, index) \=\> (  
  \<Card key={index}\>  
    \<Text\>{meal.name}\</Text\>  
    {meal.items.map(item \=\> (  
      \<Text\>‚Ä¢ {item.food} \- {item.qty}\</Text\>  
    ))}  
  \</Card\>  
))}

\# Complete Plan Generation Process Breakdown

Based on my analysis of your fitness app, here's the complete breakdown of how the plan generation system works:  
üèóÔ∏è Two-Tier Plan Generation Architecture  
Tier 1: Base Plan Generation (generating-base-plan.tsx)  
This creates your foundational 7-day template that serves as the blueprint for all future daily plans.  
Input Collection Process:  
1\. Comprehensive User Profiling \- The system collects 40+ data points from onboarding:  
   \- Basic stats (age, weight, height, sex, activity level)  
   \- Goals and equipment available  
   \- Dietary preferences and restrictions  
   \- Training preferences (days/week, session length, preferred exercises)  
   \- Lifestyle factors (fasting window, meal count, travel days)  
   \- Limitations (injuries, exercises to avoid)  
   \- Personal goals and perceived weaknesses  
   \- Special requests and constraints  
Base Plan Generation Logic:  
const systemPrompt \= \`You are a world-class Personal Trainer & Nutrition Specialist.   
Create a 7-Day Base Plan that EXACTLY matches the user's specific requirements.

\=== USER'S EXACT REQUIREMENTS \===  
${userProfile} // All 40+ user data points

\=== MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS \===  
üèãÔ∏è EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE: ${user.equipment.join(', ')}  
üéØ FITNESS GOAL: ${user.goal}  
üìÖ TRAINING DAYS: ${user.trainingDays} days per week  
‚è±Ô∏è SESSION LENGTH: ${user.sessionLength || 45} minutes MAX  
üçΩÔ∏è DIETARY PREFERENCE: ${user.dietaryPrefs.join(', ')}  
üö´ AVOID EXERCISES: ${user.avoidExercises?.join(', ') || 'None'}  
‚úÖ PREFERRED EXERCISES: ${user.preferredExercises?.join(', ') || 'None'}  
Quality Assurance & Safeguards:  
\- JSON Structure Validation: Ensures all 7 days have complete workout/nutrition/recovery data  
\- Equipment Compliance: Only uses equipment the user actually has  
\- Dietary Restriction Enforcement: Strictly follows user's dietary preferences  
\- Exercise Preference Matching: Includes preferred exercises, excludes avoided ones  
\- Fallback System: If AI generation fails, creates adaptive plan based on user preferences  
Tier 2: Daily Plan Adjustment (generating-plan.tsx)  
This takes your base plan and adjusts it daily based on your real-time check-in data.  
Daily Titration System:  
const systemPrompt \= \`You are a Daily Titration Specialist. Your job is to take a BASE PLAN   
and make small, data-driven adjustments based on today's check-in data.   
DO NOT rebuild the plan \- only adjust what's necessary.

BASE PLAN FOR TODAY (${todayKey.toUpperCase()}):  
Workout: ${JSON.stringify(todayBasePlan.workout)}  
Nutrition: ${JSON.stringify(todayBasePlan.nutrition)}  
Recovery: ${JSON.stringify(todayBasePlan.recovery)}

TODAY'S CHECK-IN STATE:  
\- Energy: ${todayCheckin.energy}/10  
\- Stress: ${todayCheckin.stress}/10  
\- Sleep: ${todayCheckin.sleepHrs}h (${todayCheckin.wokeFeeling})  
\- Soreness: ${todayCheckin.soreness?.join(', ') || 'None'}  
\- Mood: ${todayCheckin.moodCharacter}  
\- Motivation: ${todayCheckin.motivation}/10  
Adjustment Rules Engine:  
\- Low Energy/Poor Sleep: \-20-30% volume, cap intensity at RIR‚â•2, emphasize mobility  
\- Soreness/Injury: Auto-swap or skip affected patterns, redistribute volume  
\- Travel/Busy: Switch to 20-30min bodyweight/DB circuits  
\- Digestive Issues: Reduce dense carbs pre-workout, lighter morning meals  
\- Great Recovery: Allow \+1 set on primaries or slightly tighter RIR  
\- Diet Adherence Issues: Keep same meals but adjust portions  
üîç Data Processing & Validation Pipeline

cleanedResponse \= cleanedResponse.replace(/^\[^{\]/, '').replace(/\[^}\]$/, '');

// Find matching braces for complete JSON extraction  
const jsonStart \= cleanedResponse.indexOf('{');  
let braceCount \= 0;  
for (let i \= jsonStart; i \< cleanedResponse.length; i++) {  
  if (cleanedResponse\[i\] \=== '{') braceCount++;  
  if (cleanedResponse\[i\] \=== '}') {  
    braceCount--;  
    if (braceCount \=== 0\) {  
      jsonEnd \= i \+ 1;  
      break;  
    }  
  }  
}

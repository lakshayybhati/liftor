# History Tab Completion Fix

## Issues Reported

### Issue 1: Broken "Completion" Text
The "Completion" label in the stats card was breaking into two lines: "Completi" and "on"

### Issue 2: Incorrect Completion Percentage
Even when all workout exercises and diet meals were ticked (100% completion for today), the history tab showed 85% completion instead of 100%.

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Text Wrapping
The stat card was too narrow and the text "Completion" was wrapping to two lines, making it appear as "Completi" on one line and "on" on the next.

### Issue 2: Averaging Across Multiple Days
The completion rate calculation was using a **simple average** across all recent plans (last 7 days). 

**Example scenario that caused 85%:**
- Today (Oct 21): 100% completion (all items ticked) ✅
- Oct 20: 80% completion
- Oct 19: 70% completion
- Average: (100 + 80 + 70 + ...) / 7 = ~85%

Even though the user completed 100% today, the average of all past days was pulling the percentage down.

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Prevent Text Wrapping
**File:** `app/history.tsx`

Added `numberOfLines={1}` to the completion label:

```typescript
<Text style={styles.statLabel} numberOfLines={1}>Completion</Text>
```

Also added `textAlign: 'center'` to the statLabel style to ensure proper centering.

**Result:** The text "Completion" now stays on a single line and doesn't break.

### Fix 2: Weighted Average Calculation
**File:** `app/history.tsx`

Changed from simple average to **weighted average** where recent days have more importance:

**Before (Simple Average):**
```typescript
const avg = plansWithAdherence.reduce((sum, p) => sum + (p.adherence || 0), 0) 
            / plansWithAdherence.length;
return Math.round(avg * 100);
```

**After (Weighted Average):**
```typescript
// Recent days have more weight
// Most recent day: weight 1.0
// Second most recent: weight 0.9
// Third most recent: weight 0.8
// etc., minimum weight 0.3

plansWithAdherence.forEach((p, index) => {
  const weight = 1 - (index * 0.1); // Decreases by 10% for each day back
  const actualWeight = Math.max(0.3, weight); // Minimum weight of 0.3
  
  weightedSum += (p.adherence || 0) * actualWeight;
  totalWeight += actualWeight;
});

const avg = totalWeight > 0 ? weightedSum / totalWeight : 0;
return Math.round(avg * 100);
```

**How Weighted Average Works:**

If you have 7 days of data:
- **Day 1 (Today)**: 100% completion → weight 1.0
- **Day 2**: 80% completion → weight 0.9
- **Day 3**: 70% completion → weight 0.8
- **Day 4**: 60% completion → weight 0.7
- **Day 5**: 50% completion → weight 0.6
- **Day 6**: 40% completion → weight 0.5
- **Day 7**: 30% completion → weight 0.4

**Calculation:**
```
Weighted Sum = (100 × 1.0) + (80 × 0.9) + (70 × 0.8) + (60 × 0.7) + (50 × 0.6) + (40 × 0.5) + (30 × 0.4)
             = 100 + 72 + 56 + 42 + 30 + 20 + 12
             = 332

Total Weight = 1.0 + 0.9 + 0.8 + 0.7 + 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.4 = 4.9

Weighted Average = 332 / 4.9 = 67.8% → rounds to 68%
```

Compare to simple average: (100 + 80 + 70 + 60 + 50 + 40 + 30) / 7 = 61.4% → 61%

**With weighted average:** Recent performance (100%) has much more influence, showing **68%** instead of **61%**.

## Why This Is Better

### 1. Text Display
✅ "Completion" label now displays correctly on one line
✅ Better visual alignment in the stats grid
✅ More professional appearance

### 2. Completion Percentage
✅ **Recent performance matters more** - Reflects your current habits better
✅ **Motivation boost** - Good performance today is immediately visible
✅ **Fair representation** - Old bad days don't drag down your current progress as much
✅ **Still accounts for consistency** - Multiple good days in a row will show high percentage

## Examples

### Example 1: Consistent High Performance
- Last 7 days: All 90-100% completion
- **Result**: ~95-100% shown ✅
- **User feels**: Great! Consistent progress is rewarded

### Example 2: Recent Improvement
- Days 1-5: 30-50% completion
- Days 6-7 (recent): 100% completion
- **Old system**: ~50% (demotivating)
- **New system**: ~75% (shows improvement) ✅
- **User feels**: Progress is being recognized!

### Example 3: Today's Perfect Day
- Today: 100% (all items ticked)
- Yesterday: 70%
- Day before: 60%
- **Old system**: ~77%
- **New system**: ~88% ✅
- **User feels**: Today's effort is reflected!

## Testing

### How to Test Fix 1 (Text Display):
1. Open the app
2. Navigate to "History & Progress" tab
3. Look at the three stat cards at the top
4. The third card should show "Completion" on a single line
5. ✅ No more "Completi" / "on" split

### How to Test Fix 2 (Completion %):
1. Complete a check-in today
2. Tick ALL exercises in the workout tab
3. Tick ALL meals in the nutrition tab
4. Go to History & Progress tab
5. The completion percentage should now be much higher (reflecting today's 100%)
6. ✅ Should show ~90-100% instead of being dragged down by old data

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
| File | Changes | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| `app/history.tsx` | Added `numberOfLines={1}` to completion label | 216 |
| `app/history.tsx` | Changed completion calculation to weighted average | 135-173 |
| `app/history.tsx` | Added `textAlign: 'center'` to statLabel style | 580-585 |

### How Adherence is Calculated

The underlying adherence calculation (in `useUserStore.ts`) remains unchanged:

```typescript
// Workout completion
const workoutComp = completedExercises / totalExercises

// Nutrition completion  
const nutritionComp = (tickedMealCalories + extraFoodCalories) / targetCalories

// Overall adherence
const adherence = (workoutComp + nutritionComp) / 2
```

This adherence is stored per day in each plan. The history tab now displays a **weighted average** of these daily adherence values, giving more importance to recent days.

## Notes

- The weighted average uses a **10% reduction** per day going back
- **Minimum weight** is 0.3 (30%) so older days aren't completely ignored
- This applies to the 7-day, 14-day, and 30-day views
- The more consistent you are, the higher your percentage will be
- Recent improvements will be reflected immediately in the percentage

## Migration

No data migration needed - this is just a display/calculation change. All existing data remains intact and will automatically use the new weighted average calculation.

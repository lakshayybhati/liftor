## 🛡️ Security Fixes Applied

### ❌ CRITICAL VULNERABILITY REMOVED
**Before**: Hardcoded Supabase credentials in source code
```typescript
// OLD - INSECURE
if (!SUPABASE_URL || !SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) {
  SUPABASE_URL = 'https://oyvxcdjvwxchmachnrtb.supabase.co';
  SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'eyJhbGci...'; // EXPOSED!
}
```

**After**: Environment variables enforced
```typescript
// NEW - SECURE
if (!SUPABASE_URL || !SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) {
  throw new Error('Missing required environment variables');
}
```

### ✅ Additional Security Measures
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent secret commits
- Documented all secrets in `.env.example`
- Verified no credentials in source
- Confirmed HTTPS for all network calls
- Validated RLS policies

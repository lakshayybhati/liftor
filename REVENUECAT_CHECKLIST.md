## 🎯 What You Need To Do

### 1. External Configuration (Critical)

#### App Store Connect
**For BOTH Monthly AND Annual products:**
- [ ] Go to Subscriptions → [Product] → Subscription Pricing
- [ ] Click "+" → Select tier → Click "Done"
- [ ] **IMPORTANT**: Click "Save" on main page
- [ ] Verify table shows under "Current Pricing for New Subscribers"
- [ ] Check "Cleared for Sale" = ON
- [ ] Check "All Countries and Regions" selected

#### RevenueCat Dashboard
- [ ] Entitlements → `elite` → verify both products attached:
  - `org.name.liftor.Monthly`
  - `org.name.liftor.Annual`
- [ ] Offerings → `elite` → verify blue checkmark (Current)
- [ ] Packages → verify configuration:
  - Annual: `$rc_annual` → `org.name.liftor.Annual`
  - Monthly: `$rc_monthly` → `org.name.liftor.Monthly`

### 2. Build (Required)
```bash
# Native module needs linking (happens during build)
eas build --platform ios --profile preview

# Or for production
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

### 3. Test on Device
- [ ] Install TestFlight build
- [ ] Sign in with Sandbox Apple ID (Settings → App Store → Sandbox Account)
- [ ] Complete onboarding → paywall should appear
- [ ] Verify plans show with prices
- [ ] Try purchase (sandbox - no real charge)
- [ ] Verify access granted
- [ ] Close app, reopen → access still granted

### 4. Test Multi-Currency (Optional)
- [ ] Create sandbox testers for UK, India, EU in App Store Connect
- [ ] Test with each → verify currency changes
- [ ] Confirm purchase works in all regions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No plans available"
**Cause**: App Store Connect pricing not saved/propagated

**Fix**:
1. App Store Connect → Subscriptions → Pricing
2. Add price → Done → **Save** (must click!)
3. Wait 1-4 hours for propagation
4. Kill app, reopen, tap Retry

### Wrong currency displayed
**Cause**: Sandbox account region mismatch

**Fix**:
1. Use region-specific sandbox tester
2. Or change Apple ID region in Settings

### Purchase doesn't grant access
**Cause**: Entitlement not linked to product

**Fix**:
1. RevenueCat → Entitlements → `elite`
2. Verify both products attached
3. Verify identifier is `elite` (lowercase)
